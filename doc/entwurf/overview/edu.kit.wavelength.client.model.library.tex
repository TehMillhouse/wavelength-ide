The \texttt{\pkglnk{model.library}} contains classes representing the different libraries provided by the application.
Each library consists of a collection of commonly needed lambda terms and corresponding names used to reference them in input lambda terms.
After enabling a library  these names can be used in place of the longer and more difficult to work with terms.

The \texttt{\lnk{Boolean}} library contains the terms representing the boolean values "true" and "false".

The \texttt{\lnk{TuplesAndLists}} library contains the terms implementing tuples and lists and the functions needed to work with them.

The \texttt{\lnk{NaturalNumbers}} library contains the church encodings of the natural numbers and terms implementing basic arithmic functions.

The \texttt{\lnk{YCombinator}} library contains the Y combinator making recursive function calls possible.

All libraries implement the {\lnk{Library}} interface allowing the application to be expanded with more libraries provided they too implement this interface.

The library classes are used by the parser to access the terms belonging to names in the input String. 
After it has been successfully parsed each used library term is represented by a named term in the lamba term object structure.
