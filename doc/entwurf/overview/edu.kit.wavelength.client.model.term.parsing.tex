Overview of \texttt{\pkg} with UML diagram.

The \texttt{\pkglnk{model.parsing}} package contains the classes necessary to turn an input String into a lambda term object.
This process is initiate by the {\lnk{ExecutionEngine}} instancing a new Parser object with the currently activated libraries and invoking its parse method. 
The Parser in turn uses the Tokeniser to turn the input String into a sequence of Tokens. From this sequence the Parser builds a lambda term object structure.
If the input contains names referencing library terms and the Parser has been initialized with the necessary libraries, the terms will be incorporated in the lambda term object and their names conserved.
 
If the input String can not be parsed a {\lnk{ParseEception}} is thrown.
The {\lnk{ParseEception}} contains an error message describing the error which led to its creation, and where in the input String the error occurred.
Both message and location can accessed and printed to the output window to aid the user in correcting the error.
