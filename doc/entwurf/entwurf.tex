\section{Introduction}

This document contains the design for "Wavelength", a web-based IDE for the untyped
lambda calculus, as described in the \textit{Pflichtenheft}.

The object-oriented architecture of the project follows the model-view-controller (MVC)
architectural pattern. It consists of two largely indepentent sets of packages.

\subsection{The model}

The first set of packages (\texttt{\pkglnk{model}} and its subpackages) comprises most of the model and provides means for interactively, but
synchronously, operating on lambda terms. It is designed as a library that makes few
assumptions about how it is used.

It provides a package with a very general set of classes representing
lambda terms as a tree structure of immutable objects. For operations on these lambda
terms, the visitor pattern is utilized. Since many operations performed on lambda terms
fall into a few categories (for example displaying terms in some way or transforming a term
into another term), some special abstract visitors are provided in order to make these common
operations less cumbersome. For the most fundamental operations on lambda terms, concrete
visitors are provided, but the visitor interface may be implemented by any entity wishing
to operate on lambda terms (for instance reduction orders or the user interface for displaying
terms).

In addition to lambda terms and visitors and the ability to parse strings into
lambda terms, the model provides interfaces for reduction orders,
output sizes and libraries as well as the implementations of the concrete reductions orders,
output sizes and libraries mentioned in the \textit{Pflichtenheft}. These three
concepts are each fully contained in serparate packages which only use the package
providing lambda terms.

The central interface of the model to the user interface is the
\texttt{\hyperref[type:edu.kit.wavelength.client.model.ExecutionEngine]{ExecutionEngine}}
class, which manages the state of an interactive reduction of a lambda term. It
keeps the current state and history of the execution and allows performing the next
reduction step, either of a supplied redex or according to the currently set reduction
order.
