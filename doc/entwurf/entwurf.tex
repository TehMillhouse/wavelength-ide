\section{Introduction}

This document contains the design for "Wavelength", a web-based IDE for the untyped
lambda calculus, as described in the \textit{Pflichtenheft}.

The object-oriented architecture of the project follows the model-view-controller (MVC)
architectural pattern. It consists of two largely independent sets of packages.

\subsection{The model}

The first set of packages (\texttt{\pkglnk{model}} and its subpackages) comprises most of the model and provides means for interactively, but
synchronously, operating on lambda terms. It is designed as a library that makes few
assumptions about how it is used.

It provides a package with a very general set of classes representing
lambda terms as a tree structure of immutable objects. For operations on these lambda
terms, the visitor pattern is utilized. Since many operations performed on lambda terms
fall into a few categories (for example displaying terms in some way or transforming a term
into another term), some special abstract visitors are provided in order to make these common
operations less cumbersome. For the most fundamental operations on lambda terms, concrete
visitors are provided, but the visitor interface may be implemented by any entity wishing
to operate on lambda terms (for instance reduction orders or the user interface for displaying
terms).

In addition to lambda terms and visitors and the ability to parse strings into
lambda terms, the model provides interfaces for reduction orders,
output sizes and libraries as well as the implementations of the concrete reductions orders,
output sizes and libraries mentioned in the \textit{Pflichtenheft}. These three
concepts are each fully contained in separate packages which only use the package
providing lambda terms.

The central interface of the model to the user interface is the
\texttt{\hyperref[type:edu.kit.wavelength.client.model.ExecutionEngine]{ExecutionEngine}}
class, which manages the state of an interactive reduction of a lambda term. It
keeps the current state and history of the execution and allows performing the next
reduction step, either of a supplied redex or according to the currently set reduction
order.

\subsection{The user interface}

The second set of packages (\texttt{\pkglnk{view}} and its subpackages) manages building the UI 
and enabling UI elements to interact with the Model.

In order to abstract the necessary aspects of UI elements the \texttt{\pkglnk{view.api}} package 
defines elementary interfaces.
For a further narrowing of aspects the \texttt{\pkglnk{view.webui.component}} package wraps some of 
GWT's widgets using the Adapter Pattern (each in its own class).

Regarding user interaction the UI elements are able to run Actions as specified in the 
\texttt{\hyperref[type:edu.kit.wavelength.client.view.action.Action]{Action}} interface when used (on click for example).
Actions are supposed to cover an abundance of manipulations on other UI elements or even the Model.

Since providing concurrency for the reduction of LambdaTerms is crucial for maintaining responsiveness of the UI 
the \texttt{\pkglnk{view.execution}} package provides a Wrapper class for the ExecutionEngine class and an associated
Observer interface.

The communication between the View and the Model is handled by the App class. It stores all available UI elements and
an Executor (wrapped ExecutionEngine) and provides access to them. This feature is essential for Actions giving them
easy access to resources.
The general \texttt{\pkglnk{view}} package provides the App class but also a URLSerializer class for serializing a URL
and the associated Observer class.

The \texttt{\pkglnk{view.update}} package provides concrete Observers for serialization and execution along with
Visitors for resolving Lambda-Terms according to different outputFormats.

The \texttt{\pkglnk{view.export}} package provides means of transforming the output to a specific Format.

Lastly there is an Exercise Mode available represented by the \texttt{\pkglnk{view.exercise}} package providing
an interface, a concrete implementation and a static list of all exercises.

\section{Amendments to the requirements laid out in the \textit{Pflichtenheft}}

Regarding entry F17 in the "Pflichtenheft":
Enabling test cases raises complexity too much to be considered at this point of time.
According to F17 it is possible that an exercises gives predefined variables which
are set in the test cases. This leads to the problem that in order for a substitution of
those variables some kind of pre-parser needs to be utilized.
Hence the decision to not implement test cases for Exercises.
